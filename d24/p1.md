# AoC 2021 Day 24

There are 14 segments of length 18, each starting with `inp w`. These segments are identical everywhere except in 3 instructions, namely

* 5th instr: `div z a`;
* 6th instr: `add x b`;
* 15th instr: `add y c`;

where `a`, `b`, `c` vary as follows:

* $a \in \{1, 26\}$;
* $b \in \{10, 11, 12, 13\}$ if $a = 1$, else $-13 \leq b \leq 0$;
* $0 \leq c \leq 16$.

A generic segment is given below, along with a step-by-step Python translation:

```
inp w     w = input()
mul x 0   x = 0
add x z   x += z
mod x 26  x %= 26
div z a   z //= a
add x b   x += b
eql x w   x = int(x == w)
eql x 0   x = int(x == 0)
mul y 0   y = 0
add y 25  y += 25
mul y x   y *= x
add y 1   y += 1
mul z y   z *= y
mul y 0   y = 0
add y w   y += w
add y c   y += c
mul y x   y *= x
add z y   z += y
```

Or, compressed into more readable Python,

```py
w = input()
relation = z % 26 + b == w
z //= a
if not relation:
    z = 26 * z + w + c
```

Each segment has a fixed value of `(a, b, c)`, specified by the input. We need to choose 14 values of `w`. The variable `z` persists across segments, and we need it to be `0` after segment 14.

Since `a` is either 1 or 26, it's useful to think of `z` as a base-26 number. In this view, `relation` is `True` exactly if the last digit of `z` matches `w - b`. We then either lop off a digit of `z`, if `a` is `26`, or do nothing. Then, if `relation` was `False`, we append the digit `w + c` to `z`.

Initially `z == 0`, i.e. it has "zero digits" in base-26.

* There are 7 tuples with `a == 1`. Notice in this case that `relation` is always `False` since `b > 9`, but we require each `w <= 9` as well. Since `z //= 1` is a no-op, in each of these 7 cases we add a digit `w + c` to `z`.
* There are 7 tuples with `a == 26`. In this case `b` is always nonpositive, so `relation` may or may not be `True`. In this case we always lop off a digit from `z`, but if `relation` is `False` we add another digit right back.

Actual values of `(a, b, c)` for each segment and their interpretations are given below:

```py
0:  (1, 11, 1)      # add digit w0 + 1 to z
1:  (1, 10, 10)     # a.d. w1 + 10
2:  (1, 13, 2)      # a.d. w2 + 2
3:  (26, -10, 5)    # a.d. w3 + 5 if relation, else delete digit
4:  (1, 11, 6)      # a.d. w4 + 6
5:  (1, 11, 0)      # a.d. w5
6:  (1, 12, 16)     # a.d. w6 + 16
7:  (26, -11, 12)   # a.d. w7 + 12 or d.d.
8:  (26, -7, 15)    # a.d. w8 + 15 or d.d.
9:  (1, 13, 7)      # a.d. w9 + 7
10: (26, -13, 6)    # a.d. w10 + 6 or d.d.
11: (26, 0, 5)      # a.d. w11 + 5 or d.d.
12: (26, -11, 6)    # a.d. w12 + 6 or d.d.
13: (26, 0, 15)     # a.d. w13 + 15 or d.d.
```

Since `z` must have "zero digits" at the end, and we know the `a == 1` tuples will add 7 digits, we need `relation` to hold in each `a == 26` tuple such that they only remove digits from `z`. This reduces the problem to a system of 7 equations, where we track digit additions and deletions across segments as if `z` were a stack:

* $w_0 + 1 = w_{13}$
* $w_1 + 10 = w_{12} + 11$
* $w_2 + 2 = w_3 + 10$
* $w_4 + 6 = w_{11}$
* $w_5 = w_8 + 7$
* $w_6 + 16 = w_7 + 11$
* $w_9 + 7 = w_{10} + 13$

Finding the maximal model number is then a matter of choosing the solution to this system with the highest possible most significant digits, e.g.

$$w_0 + 1 = w_{13} \implies w_0 = 8, w_{13} = 9,$$

which yields the solution for part 1

$$89913949293989$$`

and, doing the opposite for part 2,

$$12911816171712.$$
